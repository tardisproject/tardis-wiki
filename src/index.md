# TARDIS

The Tardis Project is a computing facility, run and maintained by students (and staff!) of The University of Edinburgh. It was one of the first such projects of its kind, founded in 1988 by the School of Informatics (previously Department of Computer Science).

Tardis provides services to members of the University, such as web hosting and mail access. 

One of the Tardis Project's main aims is to allow students at the university to be involved in running a large computing system, and learn the experience required to design, build and maintain such a system. 

This wiki is currently a work in progress, as we migrate from our (already outdated) MediaWiki setup and rebuild our systems.

### NFS Server Transition - Today (Thurs 9th)

We need to take down things for a couple of hours to transition the [NFS

[Dalek](Dalek "wikilink") onto the new NFS server
[Piper](Piper "wikilink").

*Tardis will be down for at most the whole of NEXT WEEK - There are
building works in the room and we need to move the rack. We will be
transporting some minimal infrastructure to another location for the
interim. [Mail](Mail_Service "wikilink") access will be available as
usual. Shell access will be available on [Mccoy](Mccoy "wikilink"),
which is `ssh-old.tardis.ed.ac.uk`. We will try and point the existing
ssh.tardis record at mccoy again as well.*

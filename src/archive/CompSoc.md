**CompSoc** is the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk)'s main
student computing society and operates primary from the [School of
Informatics](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk).

Tardis has had quite strong connections with CompSoc over the years and
a number of former CompSoc committee members and students have ended up
in Tardis. Although Tardis and CompSoc both have a lot in common, being
the two big computing groups on campus, they serve different and
complimentary roles in the University community.

## Hosting

Tardis provides CompSoc with a number of services. Tardis currently
hosts the CompSoc server 'Jupiter' who's primary role is to host VMs
that run the CompSoc website & Minecraft server (Europa)

### Mailing List

CompSoc previously had a mailing list on the [Lists
Service](Lists_Service "wikilink") but it appears to be deactivated at
the moment.

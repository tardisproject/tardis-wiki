## `/admin` docs

We need to copy the documentation from
<http://www.tardis.ed.ac.uk/admin/> into the wiki. Fairly non-technical
process. There are potentially also various docs floating around on the
filesystems on baker etc, I think.

## User Docs

We had some user docs somewhere, they should be in the wiki. Also,
riot's docs, etc.

## Wiki

The front page could be better thought-out, etc. Smacks of evolution
rather than design.

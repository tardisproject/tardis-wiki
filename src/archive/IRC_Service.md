Tardis runs a server as part of the ImaginaryNet IRC network. The
server's address is **irc.tard.is :6697** (TLS) (works inside tardis but
not outside) - **irc.imaginarynet.uk:6697** (TLS) points to the IRC
networks round-robin (works outside tardis but not inside).

If you really must connect to Tardis IRChost from the outside world,
connect to **irc.tard.is :6697** (TLS) - other ports (incl. both
plaintext ports) are prohibited by the firewall.

A guide for users on how to connect to the network can be found
[here](Tardis_Beginner_Tutorials/5 "wikilink").

## Opers

Tardis admins encouraged to not add themselves as opers without the
consent of the other network admins.

Current Tardis opers:

-   [Ben Hussey (blip2)](User:Blip2 "wikilink")
-   [Robert Tully (Arkan)](User:Arkan "wikilink")

## Configuration

The server runs a specialised fork of IRCd-ratbox (mostly TLS patches),
which is checked out of a git repository and then compiled and
installed. Ask the IRCops in #imaginary for assistance if you ever need
to reconfigure IRChost.

IRChost is currently hosted on [Karn](Karn "wikilink") and peers
directly with the other servers

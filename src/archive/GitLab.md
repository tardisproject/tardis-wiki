GitLab is an open source web-based Git repository manager with wiki and
issue tracking features, similar to GitHub, but self-hosted.

We currently run a GitLab CE server available at
<https://cybermat.tardis.ed.ac.uk/> (running on
[Cybermat](Cybermat "wikilink"))

#### Continuous Integration

We also run a GitLab CI server, linked to the above GitLab install,
accessible at <https://ci.cybermat.tardis.ed.ac.uk/> - This currently
has a single runner running. If more are required, poke people in IRC.

**AASoc** is the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk)'s Anime
and Animation society.

## Role Account

The Tardis role account for AASoc is `aasoc` with permission to edit the
contents of the AASoc's virtual host.

At present it appears that none of the executive members of the society
have Tardis accounts.

## IRC

AASoc uses the channel [#aasoc](irc://irc.imaginarynet.uk/aasoc) on
[ImaginaryNET](http://www.imaginarynet.uk).

## Web Hosting

AASoc had been using Tardis for hosting their site. As of Thu, 24 Sep
2009 the Society Secretary (Raymond Watts) asked if this could be taken
down due to moving to a [Wordpress
account](http://aasoc.wordpress.com/).

The virtual host still exists, but now permanent redirects (HTTP 301) to
the new site to make search engines and users happy.

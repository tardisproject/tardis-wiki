There are a number of administration-related lists relevant to Tardis.

## Tardis

-   `sysmans` is the main list for discussing administration of Tardis.
    New and removed account notices are also sent here. All admins
    should be subscribed.
-   `sysmans-logs` receives log summaries. (There is also an altlogs
    address, created when new summarising software was introduced.
    Currently these get the same mail.)
-   `postfix-logs` receives summaries of mail activity. These are also
    sent to sysmans-logs.

These lists are handled by the `/etc/aliases` file on the mail server.
(Note that any lists created in this way should also have a
owner-<list name> alias to send any bounces to.)

There is also an `allusers` list handled by the normal mailing list
manager.

## External Tardis

Should talk about assistants and timelords lists here, but haven't yet.

## External Edinburgh lists

The University have some useful lists:

-   `edlan-announce` provides alerts about EdLAN and JANET outages.
    These are also available on the web and the university's news
    server, for details see [the EUCS NSD mailing lists
    page](http://www.ucs.ed.ac.uk/nsd/nsd-mlist.html).
-   `mail-managers` is a list for mail system adminstrators from across
    UK academia.

Platform specific lists (like sunmans) might be interesting to some.

## Draft Case

### An overview of the project

Instituted in 1987, the TARDIS Project is a student-operated computing
facility, hosted by the Informatics Department at the University of
Edinburgh. Our systems currently reside in the Informatics Forum.

The project provides free web hosting, e-mail accounts, mailing lists
and other services to registered students and staff from the University.
Thanks to our pool of local student system administrators, we are able
to continually maintain and tailor our services to meet the ongoing
requirements of our users; including services for student clubs and
societies.

### Our aims

While we place great importance on the uninterrupted provision of
service to our users, this in itself is only one goal of the project. We
also aim to gather and foster a local community of practically-trained
system administrators from the University of Edinburgh.

Students interested in system administration are welcomed and can join
the discussion and development of the project, and those with some
existing experience - though perhaps only in small-scale system
administration - are able to work with a real, live computing facility
with a large user base.

### Our requirements

To assist recruitment of new members and day-to-day maintenance, we
would ideally like to move Tardis to a location near George Square. Our
physical security is somewhat limited at the moment, and a location
restricted to Informatics students would be perfect, though we realize
that this is a non-trivial requirement, and are glad to discuss the
alternative options.

### Pros

-   Tardis used to provide training/tutorial sessions to students, by
    students and external speakers, for free.

This is a big point. We did have regular attendees and figures showing
how many people came along. It provides both experience to students for
improving presentation skills, and demonstrates an enthusiasm for people
to learn off their own backs.

-   We can provide a safe (Xen) introduction to new sys admins
-   We provide a realistic environment for system administration with
    large numbers of users and large volumes of data
-   We provide a realistic environment for learning and experimenting
    with real-world network technologies
-   Skills users and admins can gain are not generally taught in
    Informatics courses, since they're somewhat more
    practical/vocational than theoretical
-   We provide useful services for students (though people might
    potentially think it's wrong if these are provided long-term?)
-   We provide useful services for societies with sys-admin capable
    members
-   We have hardware such as the Cisco kit, the Suns, the Intel Xeon box
    and the rack, which students will not have access to elsewhere.
-   A /24

Tardis exists to:

-   Gather and promote system administration talent in Informatics
-   Help the effective use and management of computer technology amongst
    University societies
-   Provide an environment for discussion regarding sysadmin
    technologies (established and new)

Probably would be worth pointing out:

-   That people have blagged jobs through Tardis contacts or Timelords
    or something.
-   Timelord types make good contacts in general (or at least, Steve
    likes to give us hardware).
-   That people feel they've learned something through Tardis, and that
    it makes for good CV pimping.
-   That we have a quite surprising number of active users and societies
    using us (quite potentially 3 figures)
-   People have used our services and environment to do their
    projects/dissertations. (We got another query about this kinda thing
    last week)

### Cons

Counter arguements against tardis which we would expect to be presented
with. If possible, a sensible rubuke to each argument would help in
defending tardis's case if required.

-   People have linux systems at home these days, they don't need tardis

Administering home-user linux systems is incomparable to running a
shared multi-user installation with a number of live internet-facing
services. The practices and processes required to run such sites are
entirely omitted for home user systems. Tardis also provides admins with
a suitable user base to appreciate usage issues with services they
deploy yet does not put real world pressures on students.

-   Why can't tardis just use a mesh network/vpn/blah to provide the
    same service?

A mesh network does not represent any real world situation and suffers a
number of drawbacks. Whilst such a deployment would be of interest in
its own right, it does not cover the situation which tardis provides.

Project members have dabbled in such networking projects in the past,
but have found they get easily neglected.

-   People have suitable resources from the university, why do they need
    tardis?

The university runs all their own systems. The act of running the
systems is kept transparent to the students who do not appreciate the
amount of work which goes in to maintaining those systems or some of the
complex challenges faced in this process.

### Requirements

What do we really require?

-   Xen hosts (how many?)
    -   What physical hardware currently exists to provide this
    -   Could an exchange be made, reducing space if additional hardware
        can be provided?
-   Networking equipment

What would help us:

-   A small amount of space (one rack) in an inf-student-accessible
    location

What we require, worst-case:

-   A machine with network access, or funding for colo elsewhere

What we need to do:

-   Get more people interested (ESSENTIAL!)
-   Reduce our heat output and footprint

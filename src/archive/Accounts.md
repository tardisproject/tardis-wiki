## Account Applications

Tardis accounts are currently open to all students and staff at the
University of Edinburgh. Accounts may also be granted for additional
circumstances, but those wishing to apply for this must contact us
directly for more information. Those with no connection to the
university will not be granted an account.

Those wishing to become more involved in tardis and join the admin team
will need an account on the system to start with. It is recommended that
you note your interest when applying for an account so that we can
provide you with further information.

## What

With the advent of our PBX service on sat5, we need a numbering plan!

## Proposal:

-   1 XXXX - "User" numbers, each user can have one or more numbers from
    here, for use with actual phones
-   2 XXXX - "User Service" numbers, redial, voicemail, etc
-   4 XXXX - "Global Service" numbers, numbers that do something
    useful/fun
-   8 ... - "Dial-out" prefix, to access other trunked PBXs
-   others - Reserved

## FAQ

### Why five-digit numbers?

I felt like it. Four digits after each prefix will probably (i say) be
enough. Though there is nothing stopping us from using variable-length
numbers in the future.

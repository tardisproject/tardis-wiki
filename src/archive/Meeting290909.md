### Discussed

#### Future Location of Tardis

-   Weighed up access opportunities to the forum against possibility of
    obtaining space another department
-   A cupboard in Appleton Tower for setup/storage would be useful
-   Agreed that the housing tardis in the informatics forum is probably
    the best solution
-   We will probably be restricted to access within teaching hours but
    we will have to work around this.

#### Tutorials/Workshops/Talks

-   Workshops dependant on space to play with servers
-   Talks about something (sjh: DNS/bind?) (Jay: webservers?)

#### Cluster Project

-   Has potential to be turned off if Inf deem us to be using too much
    power \* cluster can be used 'on demand'
-   Networking for nodes plugged into head node
-   NetLOM of each node plugged into switch
-   LOM passwords need changed

#### Gamesoc

-   New agreement see [GameSoc](GameSoc "wikilink")
-   Server will need to talk out to the internet on certain ports (some
    gameservers require this to function)
-   Possible wake-on-lan (server will probably only be used once a week)
-   Steve will try to <s>pinch</s> acquire a nice server for them to use
    (Intel based please)

#### Router

-   Possibly use a Sun 210 as the router
-   Has gigabyte network card with four interfaces
-   LOM (network plugged straight into Inf network) as a fallback if it
    breaks

#### Other Boxes

-   Other 210: possibly install solaris to make sjh happy
-   Move donated stuff (BT donated) to cupboard

#### Decommision

-   2x Netra (will need returned to Charles)
-   Adric can be decommissioned

#### Networking

-   Rearrange VLans to make things neater
-   Network management in separate Vlan
-   Cluster and network management in own Vlan

#### Other

-   Open up outbound IRC (through bouncer to prevent port-forwarding via
    ssh)

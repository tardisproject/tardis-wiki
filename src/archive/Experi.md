Experi is the hostname for the [Jabber
Service](Jabber_Service "wikilink"), it is not a real machine, just an
IP alias for [colin](colin "wikilink"). It is an IN A record instead of
a CNAME because of some strange business with the way
[Jabber](Jabber_Service "wikilink") works, who knows.
([bacam](user:bacam "wikilink") probably does).

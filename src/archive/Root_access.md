Tardis has always been fairly trusting of it's admins with respects to
holding root. This is entirely due to the nature of the project, and we
shall continue with this arrangement. In commercial setups, it is not
uncommon to restrict root access to a very limited subset of
administrators and have them request the root holders to make changes.
Doing so for us would be highly impractical and damaging to the project
by overly binding us to this restriction.

Normally the root password will be retained by only a core number of
administrators, and the remainder will be granted sudo access. Root
access shall be granted to administrators when it is deemed that they
are fit to be granted it. Granting of root access will be announced on
the internal systems list in the case of new administrators.

Before being given root access, administrators will be reminded to the
conditions attached to root access.

-   Respect users privacy. Root access should never be used to inspect a
    user's files or mail, unless this is specifically required for the
    purposes of administration.
-   If in doubt about taking an action, check with an assistant or
    timelord _before_ progressing.
-   Root access must not be used to circumvent any firewalls or security
    logging systems.
-   Care must be taken to ensure any actions taken as root do not
    disrupt the running of the systems where avoidable, or to open
    systems to the possibility of security breaches.

Root access may be removed at any time. Abuse of root access will lead
to instant removal, and depending on the nature of the abuse may also
result in closure of your tardis account and/or referral to the
university for breach of the computing regulations.

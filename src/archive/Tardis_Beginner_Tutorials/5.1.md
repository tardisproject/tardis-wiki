# Tutorial 5.5: Setting up an account on Shout

Some people prefer not to connect to IRC via the command line, those
people use either [Shout](https://wiki.tardis.ed.ac.uk/index.php/Shout)
or [IRCCloud](https://www.irccloud.com). IRCCloud is a paid service so
here I will be walking you through signing up to Shout.

First off head over to
[Shout-register](https://shout-register.tardis.ed.ac.uk) to make an
account.

Next enter all of your details, choose the channels you wish to connect
to, and click register.

Now we can actually connect, so now go to
[Shout](https://shout.tardis.ed.ac.uk), enter your details and click
"Sign in"

Once you connect you should automatically join any channels you
previously chose. If, however, you did not choose any channels, you will
be greeted with a page asking for details of a network and channels.
Here you can add any channels you wish.

Now that everything is set up, you can change any settings you would
like by clicking on the gear icon at the bottom left of the page.

From this page you can change the theme (neuron is a personal
favourite), add custom css, change your password, and more.

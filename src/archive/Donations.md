People always ask me what I want. I rarely know. Sounds ripe for
collaborative documentation.

## Things we want

-   Volunteers!

### Systems

-   Reasonable computers (See note below)

### Components

-   Disks (>=80Gb)
-   RAM (especially for Ultra5's)

### Misc

-   Serial cables that work.

### Networking

-   ~~A serial console that doesn't crash.~~
-   Switches/Routers

## Things we don't want

`17:22 <@thom> we dont want computers unless they're very small, powerful or rackmount`

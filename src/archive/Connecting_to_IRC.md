## Other Clients

There are a range of IRC clients most of which take some getting used to
- here are some recommendations:

-   Pidgin ([1](http://www.pidgin.im/)) - Does just about everything
    chat-wise.

### Windows

-   mIRC ([2](http://www.mirc.com/get.html)) - The most popular IRC
    client (free but you get messages on startup asking you to pay)

### Linux

-   XChat ([3](http://www.xchat.org/download/)) - Windows version isn't
    free but a nice GUI linux chat client.
-   irssi ([4](http://irssi.org/download)) - Console based IRC client,
    clean and highly configurable.
-   weechat

### Web-based

-   KiwiIRC ([5](https://kiwiirc.com/)) - Pleasant browser-based chat
    client; however most native clients are more reliable and should be
    used when possible.
-   mibbit ([6](http://www.mibbit.com/chat/)) - Another browser-based
    chat client.

Hyperion has the following RAID 1 arrays:

-   80gb - Mounted on /
-   160gb - Mounted on /export/160gb1/ - Holds Proxmox backups
-   2tb - Mounted on /export/2tb1/ - Holds home, mail and web
    directories

Uses software RAID due to the hardware RAID having issues with Debian
for some strange reason.

The pair of 2tb WD SE hard drives were donated by
[R2ZER0](User:R2ZER0 "wikilink") and are still under warranty until
early 2020. The receipts are with the important documents, or speak to
[R2ZER0](User:R2ZER0 "wikilink") for proof of purchase if replacement is
required.

#### 11 April 2017

-   The School of Informatics have identified a room that may be used as
    a dedicated server room for Tardis on level 7 of Appleton Tower.

#### 10 Feb 2017

-   It has been agreed that the School of Informatics will find a (yet
    to be determined) location for the Tardis servers within Appleton
    Tower.

#### 1 May 2015

-   Tardis is now living in the Informatics Forum Data Center. Access is
    supervised and only within business hours (Mon-Fri).

#### 14 October 2013

-   We have a webserver again! The wiki is back, and is authenticated
    against [LDAP](LDAP "wikilink"). Yay!

#### 10 July 2012

-   [Mantis](Mantis "wikilink") returns! After a 7-8 month break we have
    a webserver again. Unfortunately the old webserver data is still
    stuck on assorted (possibly corrupted) SCSI drives, if anyone wants
    to have a go at pulling the data off let us know!
-   NFS shares have moved to a new server [Astrid](Astrid "wikilink")
    which is a Xen DomU running on [Ukairo](Ukairo "wikilink") a HP
    ProLiant with two RAID arrays inc. 400GB of RAID5 which will store
    all homedir/maildir and eventually webdirs (if we get them back).

#### 29 September 2011

-   Tardis is now living in Room 5.06 in Appleton Tower. We have 24/7
    (with student card) and a key to get into the actual room (blip2
    currently holds it (and the rack keys)). We also share the room with
    of the Compsoc committee whom also have keys. See
    [ATMove](ATMove "wikilink") for more information. Also: all of the
    servers passed a PAT test (for what it's worth)

#### 28 September 2011

-   Tardis is moving again to Room 5.06 in Appleton Tower. We should
    have more space, better access (24/7) and a key to get in! \[tbc\].
    Moving will probably happen from about 1pm - any help welcome!

#### 16 November 2010

-   IPv6 'AAAA' entries in DNS have been disabled due to 6to4 tunnel
    being broken (router address is now externally firewalled preventing
    the 6in4 packets arriving).

#### 29 October 2010

-   [Ace](Ace "wikilink") is no longer in service as the router - it has
    been replaced by [Midnight](Midnight "wikilink"). However, the
    router is still 'ace' in dns to make the transition easier.

#### 14 September 2010

-   [Ace](Ace "wikilink") and [King](King "wikilink") are being
    recommissioned as routers by
    [Amazoph](Compsoc:User:Amazoph "wikilink") routing will be switched
    to the new boxes at some point in the near future.
-   Hopefully these will configured in a HA setup at some point.

#### 24 August 2010

-   [Ace](OldAce "wikilink") has been decommissioned - the router
    service is now running on [WOTAN](WOTAN "wikilink"). We had some
    downtime as a result, however all is well now.
-   We still need a more permanent solution for the main router.

#### 16 March 2010

-   All boxes are now working as intended after the move.

#### 22 February 2010

-   Tardis was moved from Forest Hill to the Informatics Forum. There
    was significant apparent downtime due to the main xen host
    ([WOTAN](WOTAN "wikilink")) freezing on boot (required a reinstall
    of the dom0).

#### 29 September 2009

-   Tardis had a [meeting](Meeting290909 "wikilink") to discuss the
    future i.e. moving out of Forest Hill and other infrastructure
    related things.

#### 7 August 2009

-   Six Sun U1 boxes were installed in the rack (with correct
    mountings - thanks Pert!), two of them will run Tardis services
    (possibly NFS/backup) and the other four will replace the five
    beowulf cluster boxes which were decommissioned to make room in the
    rack. Currently none of the boxes are running (no OS etc) but they
    should be fairly shortly.
-   Mantis, the new webserver, is currently being commissioned and
    should be in service soon.

#### 31 July 2009

-   Mantis, the new webserver was setup using some complicated adaptors
    to plug in into the serial console. It should start operations
    shortly.

#### 5 June 2009

-   The Sun Fire 280r that is to serve as our webserver was installed in
    the rack. We didn't have time to set it up properly/network it
    however.
-   Downtime was scheduled so we could also re-arrange the cabling. All
    dual-PSU boxes (ex. Oracle) now have two power supplies, one from
    each of the distro units.

#### 27 April 2009

-   Wiki has been given a makeover so it can be a front for Tardis. It's
    still a bit slow but that is the webserver's fault.

#### 07 February 2009

-   We have completed the Move of [Piper](Piper "wikilink") to the new
    box. It remains called Piper however, as that made the move simpler.

#### 13:12, 11 July 2008 (BST)

-   The move to Forest Hill went well. One PSU died, one disk had some
    issues and there's a bit more work to do on the web server but,
    other than that, tardis is working once more.

#### 19:32, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

-   We had some downtime today for for power testing. All is well.

#### 14:10, 22 November 2006 (GMT)

-   [Tardis lab](Tardis_lab "wikilink") was on the 3rd December.

#### 21:29, 5 July 2006 (BST)

-   People are on holiday. New switch going in soon. Mostly, all is
    well.

#### 23:58, 18 February 2006 (GMT)

-   [Downtime](Downtime "wikilink") didn't happen in the end, we were
    all somewhat relieved.
-   [NFS Transition](NFS_Service "wikilink") onto piper went well, aside
    from a mild duplication of mail. Next on the
    [agenda](Admin_Projects "wikilink") is the decommissioning of
    [Baker](Baker "wikilink") and [Colin](Colin "wikilink").

#### 19:20, 7 February 2006 (GMT)

-   [Downtime](Downtime "wikilink") happening soon. Sadly in a
    non-derministic fashion. Some things are out of our control.
-   The wiki is now publicly readable, but not editable. If you would
    like an account, speak to [seth](User:seth "wikilink"). Maybe one
    day we'll get LDAP auth.

#### 00:57, 18 January 2006 (GMT)

-   We had a [Tardis Day](Tardis_Day_I "wikilink"). Things were fixed.

## Introduction

The Tardis Project is a student run computing facility run at The
University of Edinburgh. Since 1987, The Tardis Project has given
students the opportunity to learn system administration and network
management skills that would otherwise be hard to provide in a
production computer facility. As such we always look to embrace new and
upcoming technology to provide practical skills for those entering the
industry.

IPv6 is the next generation networking standard intended to completely
replace IPv4 for transport of packets across the Internet. It was
designed to rectify several fundamental limitations of the existing
standard, the most pertinent being that a 32-bit address space (4.3
billion addresses) is vastly inadequate when compared with a worldwide
population of over 6.8 billion and the increasing number of personal
computing devices connected to the Internet.

IPv6 is not a new standard either. It was developed over the early
1990s, culminating in an IETF Internet Standard in December 1998. All
current generation Operating Systems have native support (since Windows
XP SP1, Linux 2.6.12 and OSX 10.3). Despite this it has not seen
widespread adoption. It is currently estimated that IANA pool will be
exhausted mid-2011 with regional pools being exhausted by early 2012.
For this reason The Tardis Project feels that now is an excellent time
to pursue IPv6 connectivity.

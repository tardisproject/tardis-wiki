Shout is an IRC Web Client / Bouncer. It does NOT host an IRCd so is
only accessible via the HTTP interface at the current time. It is
accessible at <http://shout.tardis.ed.ac.uk/> . Shout has been
configured with identd running fine from external connections only
(internal connections do not have identd support unless they query port
1113 as opposed to 113) - this has been achieved with port forwarding on
the firewall.

[User:neanias](User:neanias "wikilink") has built a registration portal
accessible at <http://shout-register.tardis.ed.ac.uk/>

## TODO

As Shout grows we will likely need to apply for some form of i-line from
networks.

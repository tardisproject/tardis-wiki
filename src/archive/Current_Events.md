Here is a list of current changes, major problems and developments going
on in Tardis.

**rphi** has set up a Trello to keep track of things currently happening
in Tardis. (One of which is to move this Trello off Trello and onto
something hosted within Tardis.)

board](https://developers.trello.com/v1.0/docs/boards) here) <noinclude>

The below information is for reference only and may well be \*very\* out
of date.

-   Close any [Queued maintenance](Queued_maintenance "wikilink")
-   Decide on a [Numbering Plan](Numbering_Plan "wikilink")
-   Get rid of some of our old (really old) hardware due to space
    limitations
-   The [Backup Infrastructure](Backup_Infrastructure "wikilink") needs
    to be addressed. We need a bigger chassis/more disks.

See also [Admin Projects](Admin_Projects "wikilink"). </noinclude> If
you would like to help us with or you would like to learn about how we
are doing any of the above projects please contact us at

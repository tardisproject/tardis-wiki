### In Person

Alternatively, you are welcome to come along to one of our meetings.
They happen virtually every Monday, and generally around 6:30pm in the
[Auld Hoose](http://www.theauldhoose.co.uk)). If you're planning on
turning up, please confirm through one of the above methods exactly
where and when we are meeting.

If you have access to Appleton Tower (most people eligible for an
account will have access to this building during working hours) you can
slide a letter under the door to 7.01A. Please send an email to
support@tardis.ed.ac.uk if you do this — we'll come along to the room
and read your letter.

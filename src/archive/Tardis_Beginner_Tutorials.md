## AKA "So You Got A Shell Account"

These tutorials are intended for the beginner Tardis user who has had
little / no prior experience with unix or linux. These documents will
therefore begin with the most basic of basics, and start by teaching you
to use the Bash shell and navigating the filesystem. If you already have
experience with \*nix and want to know the answer to a specific
questions feel free to skip to the specific part you're interested in,
as these tutorials also explain tardis-specific things that you will
need to know even if you already know your way around a linux system.

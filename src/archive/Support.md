### FAQ

#; What is Tardis?

#: [Instituted in 1987](History "wikilink"), the TARDIS Project is a
student-operated computing facility, hosted by the Informatics
Department at the University of Edinburgh. The project provides free web
hosting, e-mail accounts, mailing lists and other services to registered
students and staff from the University. Thanks to our pool of local
student system administrators, we are able to continually maintain and
tailor our services to meet the ongoing requirements of our users;
including services for student clubs and societies.

1.  What address do I use to log in to tardis?
    `ssh.tardis.ed.ac.uk`

2.  What address do I access my mail on with POP3 or IMAP?
    `pop.tardis.ed.ac.uk` for POP3 and `imap.tardis.ed.ac.uk` for IMAP.

3.  Where can I find my Tardis website?
    Internally, at `/tardis/www/users/USERNAME/pages/` and externally at
    `http://www.tardis.ed.ac.uk/~USERNAME/`.

4.  What are the different services running on Tardis, and where can I find them?
    There's a constantly updated list of services at
    [Services](Services "wikilink").

5.  Can I run this-and-that software on Tardis?
    Yes, as long as it doesn't contradict the [Edinburgh Computing
    Regulations](http://www.ucs.ed.ac.uk/EUCS/regs.html), the [JANET
    Acceptable Use Policy](http://www.ja.net/company/policies/aup.html)
    or the [Tardis Charter](Charter "wikilink"). You also should be
    considerate when compiling and running your software on Tardis, and
    renice long non-time-critical processes to an idle priority
    (`` `renice +19 [PID]` ``) so as not to annoy other users. If you
    are unsure that your software is suitable to be run on Tardis,
    please [contact](contact "wikilink") an admin.

6.  Is there a quota on disk usage in my homedir, webdir or mail, and are there bandwidth limits?
    There is no hard quota, but Tardis is a trust-based community and
    all users are expected to behave reasonably. In general, do not
    store what you don't need to in your homedir, delete old mail with
    large attachments or download it to your home computer, and don't
    host heavily bandwidth-intensive things on your webdir - if unsure,
    please [contact](contact "wikilink") an admin.

7.  What are the regulations that restrict what I may and may not do on Tardis?
    Tardis is an Edinburgh University project, connected to
    [JANET](http://www.ja.net). As a result it is bound by the
    [Edinburgh Computing
    Regulations](http://www.ucs.ed.ac.uk/EUCS/regs.html) and the [JANET
    Acceptable Use Policy](http://www.ja.net/company/policies/aup.html).
    You are also expected to abide by the [Tardis
    Charter](Charter "wikilink").

# This Wiki

This wiki is hosted on <a v-bind:href="$site.themeConfig.repository">GitHub</a>, and is compiled from a bunch of [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) files using [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).

If you notice something is out of date, unclear, or missing, feel free to submit a PR.
If you've never used GitHub before, [here's a guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) on how it works.

If you need any help, feel free to ask over [IRC/Discord](./IRC%20&%20Discord.md).

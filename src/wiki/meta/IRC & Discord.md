# IRC & Discord

Most communication is done on our IRC or through the CompSoc Discord. These two channels are bridged together, so you can use whichever you'd prefer.


## IRC

If you've never used IRC before, look [here](https://www.irchelp.org/faq/irctutorial.html) for a quick tutorial.

### Connecting

Server: **irc.imaginarynet.uk**

Port: **6697** (TLS - tick 'use TLS/SSL' in your client)

Channel: **#tardis**

### Clients

If you have a tardis account, both irssi and weechat are installed on [fez](/wiki/systems/Fez) and
[torchwood](/wiki/systems/Torchwood).

You can also use our web client hosted at [https://shout.tardis.ed.ac.uk](http://shout.tardis.ed.ac.uk)

### Other Clients

There are a range of IRC clients most of which take some getting used to
- here are some recommendations:

#### Cross Platform

-   [Pidgin](https://www.pidgin.im/) - Does just about everything
    chat-wise.

#### Windows

-   [mIRC](https://www.mirc.com/get.html) - The most popular IRC
    client (free but you get messages on startup asking you to pay)

#### Linux

-   [XChat](https://www.xchat.org/download/) - Windows version isn't
    free but a nice GUI linux chat client.
-   [irssi](https://irssi.org/download) - Console based IRC client,
    clean and highly configurable.
-   weechat

#### Web-based

-   [KiwiIRC](https://kiwiirc.com/) - Pleasant browser-based chat
    client; however most native clients are more reliable and should be
    used when possible.
-   [mibbit](https://www.mibbit.com/chat/) - Another browser-based
    chat client.

## Discord

We use the CompSoc Discord server, which can be found [here](https://comp-soc.com/chat)
